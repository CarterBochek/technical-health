              <p>Your starting point will be unique to you. There are three steps you should take when trying to understand where to begin.</p>
              <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Record your weight daily to see where you are at.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Create a health log which records your sleep, weight, everything you eat in a day and your activity level for that day.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Do physical activity for atleast 30 minutes every day.</li>
                <br>
              </ul>
              <p>I know this is alot to take in, but if you keep your physical body sound, it will be easier to focus on your mental state as well. I find it easiest to break everything into chunks until you get one aspect down.</p>

              <p>Sleep is the most underrated aspect when it comes to fitness. It controls your hormones, building muscle, learning retention and many more complex processes within the mind. It is imparitive that you get atleast <strong>8 hours</strong> of sleep.</p>             
              <p>Getting the prerequisite mentioned above will ensure that your body is both getting its daily needs met both physically and mentally.</p>
              <p>It is also important to be in bed atleast 15 minutes before you actually want to sleep because it will take time for your body to acclimate and fall asleep. 
              </p>

               Consistency is key in both your sleeping time and your waking time. You should try and keep this routine even through the weekends to ensure optimal sleep efficiency.
               </p>
                </div>
              </code>
              <p>Develop a night time ritual about an hour before you want to be in bed. This should help you wind down for the night. Something that will relax you such as reading a book and brushing your teeth. Ideally it would be something that does not involve any kind of light. Light will trick your body into releasing less melatonin, a hormone which signals the body that it is time for sleep.

                Your brain sees light as if it is the sun and will prevent you from getting sufficient rest if you are overexposed late into the night.

            <article>
              <p>Nutrition is a big part of achieving the type of physique and health you want to obtain. It is a long journey to master but it is extremely rewarding if you can stick with it. Your body will both thank you in and out.</p>
              <p>If you work a 40 hour work week like most people it will help to <strong>meal prep</strong>. That is picking one day of the week when your have about 2 - 3 hours of free time to make your food for up to 3 - 7 days in advance. If you make all of your healthy meals easily accessible, it will be easier to stick with it.</p>
              <p>Should you count calories? I would not recommend this unless you are extremely passionate about fitness and your health as it could lead to rebounding and obsessing over what you eat. Instead it is better be mindful rather than track to first look for low calorie dense foods. Examples of these foods are: 
              <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Smart Pop Popcorn</li>
                <br>
                <li>Egg White French Toast</li>
                <br>
                <li>Green Vegetables</li>
                <br>
                <li>Fruit; berries of any kind</li>     <br>   
              </ul> 
              <code>
                <div class="summary-point">
                You can still look at the nutrition label and you should, just make sure you aren't obsessing over every little thing. Think about the bigger picture.
                </div>
              </code>
                <p>You need to find alternatives to the foods you love but sub out the bad parts of them to make them better. Instead of using pure sugar and eggs to make french toast, you could use sucralose and eggwhites instead. More protein is more satiating and for most people carbs will make you more hungry.</p>
                <code>
                  <div class="summary-point">
                    Protein water intake and fiber will make you feel full even if you are not consuming as much food.

            <h2 class="art-heading">Training</h2>
            <article>
              <p>Training is the third aspect you must master in order to fully optimize your health. It is easy to get paralysis by analysis since there so many different ways to train. To simplify this we should break this down into three parts.</p>
              <p>When training it is important to rest enough after you finish a working set. A set is the number of reps you perform of an exercise until you stop. So if I did 12 dumbbell curls in a row and then stopped after 12 that would be 1 set. A rep is just short for repititions. Ideally a good guideline is to rest atleast 3 minutes between sets for optimal recovery throughout your workout.</p>
              <p>You need to focus on compound movements to build up your body and learn movement patterns. When you are just starting it is not wrong to want to try and every machine and if you are curious go ahead and try different machines. <strong>4 important compound exercises </strong>are the<strong>  pushup, pullup, squat, and romanian deadlifts</strong>.</p>
              <p>When you are a beginner it is recommended to do a full body workout program 3 days a week. This may not sound like much but your body will thank you for it. When this starts to feel easy switch to something more advance like an upper lower program. Regardless of which split you choose make sure you are working your legs and your upper body and you will build a great looking physique and optimize your health in the process.</p>
              <p>Make sure you are warming up 15 minutes before your workout. Do something to get your heartrate up and mix in some dynamic stretching. Its easy to neglect and not care about stretching but your body will thank you in the long run if you do a little bit everyday. Another neglected area for some is running. Weightlifters tend to believe you will destroy your hard earned muscle if you go for a run. While this is true for running over 30 minutes a day, the effect is not as bad as many make it out to be. In the long term running will increase your capacity for working sets and speed up your recovery time when you are resting between sets.</p>

              <p>In order to do everything in your power to optimize your health you need to:</p>
              <code>
                <div class="summary-point">
                Sleep the same time and wake the same time every day and sleep atleast 8 hours;
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Keep a health log to keep track of your weight, training sets and reps, and nutritional intake;
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  During your training sessions you need to come in with a plan. You will save yourself alot of time in effort if you are following a full body workout plan or an upper lower workout plan etc. This way you will be able to track your progress and see why you may stall in the future or why your physique is staying or lacking in certain areas;
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Remember to have fun! Good luck on your journey!
